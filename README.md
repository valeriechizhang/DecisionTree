# DecisionTree
Demonstrate a decision tree that uses the ID3 algorithm.

### Tool: Python 2.7.5

### Description:
The program accepts a set of data in .csv, and from that data produce a decision tree. It will also allow testing the accuracy of the decision tree by running test cases
against the tree and comparing the decision treeâ€™s performance against the known classifications.


id3.py: an decision tree program that only considers integer values

id3-real.py: an decision tree program that considers real number values

main.py: Provides a command-line interface to the decision tree. It takes positional parameters for the decision tree
algorithm module name, and for the name of the classification attribute. Invoke with --help to see complete list of options.


### How to run:
Run individual tests:

./main.py id3 [classification attributes] --attributes [attributes txt file] --train [train csv file] --test [test csv file]

Run all tests:

./run_tests.sh tests OR ./run_tests.sh id3-real-tests
